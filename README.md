Showcasing projects done using Python

1. Created a text-based (command line) program that takes any String input and converts it into Morse Code.

   The file for this text-based program is stringtomorse.py

   This program will ask the user for input and verifies that the input is a string text with no symbols.
   If verification is valid, the text will be translated to Morse code and displayed to the user.

   I modified the code and deployed with Streamlit.

2. This **tictactoe.py** coding project presents a classic implementation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe, featuring player-versus-AI gameplay. Utilizing Python, the code provides a complete gaming experience centered around the timeless game. Key highlights include:

   **Player Choice:** Players can choose their game piece ('X' or 'O') at the start.   
   **Strategic AI Moves:** The AI employs calculated scores to make informed, strategic decisions.
   **Game Outcome Checks:** The code incorporates checks for wins, losses, and draws, ensuring a conclusive end to each game.
   While the interface is command-line based, offering a streamlined experience, the project effectively demonstrates Python programming       concepts, algorithmic thinking, and a structured approach to building interactive games.
