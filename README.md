Showcasing projects done using Python

1. Created a text-based (command line) program that takes any String input and converts it into Morse Code.

   The file for this text-based program is stringtomorse.py

   This program will ask the user for input and verifies that the input is a string text with no symbols.
   If verification is valid, the text will be translated to Morse code and displayed to the user.

   I modified the code and deployed with Streamlit.
