# Python 
Showcasing projects done using Python

1. Created a text-based (command line) program that takes any String input and converts it into Morse Code.

   The file for this project is stringtomorse.py

   This program will ask the user for input and verifies that the input is a string text with no symbols.
   If verification is valid, the text will be translated to Morse code and displayed to the user.

   This program was deployed with streamlit.
